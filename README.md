## Features
- User login<br>
In order to write a post, writer(s) need to login into this website first. A authentication page will prompt entering username and password so as to login into the account(s). After successful login, they will be given the authorization to write new posts.
- Create / Modify / Delete posts (for writers)<br>
This is about the content part of this blog system. Writers can do the following things:
	1. Create new posts
	2. Modify existing posts
	3. Delete existing posts
- View / Comment posts (for visitors)<br>
This is about the visitors to this blog system. Since they are not writers, they can only do as follows:
	1. View all the existing posts by writers
	2. Comment and give their thoughts on existing posts by writers
- Administration system<br>
Managers can change everything in this system due to their root permission.
